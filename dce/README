Fitting consists of the following steps.

1. Convert DICOM to NIFTI of both DCE and T1 maps
2. Drawing of ROI on T1 image using MRIcro (Export ROI as an Analyze
image).
3. Making the T1 map (T1_map_Bnonlinear_COH.m)
4. Preping the dataset for fitting 
    (A_make_R1mapsCOH.m)
5. Fitting the AIF with a model
    (B_AIF_fitting_COH.m)
    Note that the model can be altered simply by switching out the fit
    function.
6. First past fitting check by fitting to the whole tumor ROI.
    C_fit_AIFnovp_COH.m    : sTANDAR mODEL
    C_fit_AIFwithvP_COH.m  : sTANDARD MoDEL WITH PLASMA
    C_fit_AIFFXR_COH.m     : Shutter speed model

7. Run the voxel-by voxel fit

    D_fit_AIFnovp_voxels_COH.m
    D_fit_AIFwithvp_voxels_COH.m
    D_fit_FXR_voxels_COH.m

========

At each step 4-7, a .mat file is saved.
At the end of Step 7, NIFTI files containing the maps for each parameter is
generated, this filters out all the unrealistic or poorly fitting
datapoints.

===========

You can check the veracity of the voxel by voxel fit by loading the .mat
file generated after step 7, and running the functions:

CHECKFXR(x, xdata)
CHECKnovp(x,xdata)
CHECKvp(x,xdata)

These pick 16 random voxels and shows the fit.

===========

Parallel matlab:

For the voxel-by voxel maps, it is desirable to have access to a multi core
computer. To turn on parallel matlab capablity, run:

matlabpool open N

Where N is the number of processors you can access. Parallel for loops are
present in the code to accomadate this, for both T1 and parametric fitting.

===========

Some of the code requies MATLAB curvefitting and stats tool box.

===========

Not yet cleaned up: Reference region capability
